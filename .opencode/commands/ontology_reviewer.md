# Ontology Reviewer v3

Audit the project's ontology against the IDLC Knowledge Architecture Policy.

> Policy reference: `design_idlc_brainstorming/ontology/IDLC_Knowledge_Architecture_Policy.md`

---

## Before you start

Determine the current state:

```bash
Glob: "knowledge/ontology/**/*.md"
Glob: "knowledge/architecture/domains/**/README.md"
Glob: "knowledge/architecture/domains/**/boundaries.md"
Glob: "knowledge/ontology/mappings/*.md"
```

Identify which maturity level the ontology is at:

| Level | Structure |
|---|---|
| 0 | `ontology/glossary.md` — flat file, all domains |
| 1 | `ontology/{domain}.md` — one file per domain |
| 2 | Level 1 + `ontology/mappings/{a}--{b}.md` |
| 3 | `ontology/domains/{domain}/glossary/{term}.md` |

If there is no ontology at all, report that and stop. Do not fabricate findings.

---

## Step 1 — Inventory

List every domain found in:
- `knowledge/architecture/domains/`
- `knowledge/ontology/domains/` (or equivalent per the current level)

For each domain, note:
- Number of terms documented
- Whether a matching entry exists in both `architecture/` and `ontology/`
- Whether any mappings exist for that domain

This produces a coverage table:

```
| Domain | Arch folder | Ontology folder | Term count | Mappings |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|------------|---------|
```

---

## Step 2 — Term Audit

For each term in the ontology, check all of the following. Report findings per term.

### 2a. Domain qualification

Every term must use a domain-qualified ID: `billing.customer`, not `customer`.

**Check**: Does the `id` field (or the `## {header}` at Level 0) include the domain prefix?

If not: flag as **MISSING DOMAIN QUALIFIER** — this must be fixed before the project grows beyond Level 0 or retrofitting becomes expensive.

### 2b. Required fields

Minimum required fields at any level:

- `id` — domain-qualified (`{domain}.{term}`)
- `context` — the owning domain
- `preferred_label` — human-readable label
- `owner` — team responsible for this definition

Flag any term missing one or more required fields as **INCOMPLETE SCHEMA**.

At Level 2+, also check that `status` is present and set to one of: `active`, `deprecated`, `proposed`.

### 2c. "Not this" section

Every term must have an explicit "Not this" (or equivalent negative definition) — at least one exclusion linking to a related term that people might confuse it with.

**Check**: Does the term body contain a sentence that starts with "Not the same as", "Not this", or an equivalent negative statement?

If not: flag as **MISSING EXCLUSION**. This is the second most important check after domain qualification. A definition without an exclusion is ambiguous by default.

### 2d. Implementation details

The following must not appear in ontology:

- Function names, method signatures, column names, internal variable names
- Processing states that never cross a domain boundary (`ProcessingInQueue`, `AwaitingRetry`)
- Obvious structural things a developer would not misunderstand (`UserRepository`, `Logger`, `Config`)
- Anything behind a feature flag or in an A/B test — those belong in `product/experiments/`

**Test**: Would a different team or an agent misunderstand or duplicate this concept without the ontology entry? If the answer is no, the entry does not belong.

Flag as **IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL — REMOVE** with a suggested destination (code comment, `product/experiments/`, or simply delete).

### 2e. Experimental content

Flag any term with `status: proposed` or whose definition references an unimplemented feature as **EXPERIMENTAL — NOT READY**. These should not appear in active catalogs until the concept is committed.

---

## Step 3 — Collision Scan

Search for the same natural-language label appearing under different domains:

```bash
Grep: "preferred_label: {Label}" in knowledge/ontology/
Grep: "## {Label}" in knowledge/ontology/
```

For each collision found:

1. Confirm the two definitions are genuinely different (different domain, different meaning). If they are identical, that is duplication — propose merging.
2. If they are legitimately different, check whether a mapping file exists at `knowledge/ontology/mappings/{domain-a}--{domain-b}.md`.
3. Check whether both terms have a `maps_to` field pointing at each other.

Flag as **UNDOCUMENTED COLLISION** if same label, different domains, no mapping file.
Flag as **MISSING MAPS_TO** if mapping file exists but the individual term files lack the `maps_to` field.
Flag as **DUPLICATE DEFINITION** if same label, same meaning, two domains — propose merging under the owning domain.

---

## Step 4 — Symmetry Check

The symmetry rule: every domain in `architecture/domains/` must have a counterpart in `ontology/domains/` and vice versa.

For each domain in the inventory table from Step 1:

- **Architecture without ontology**: domain boundary is defined but vocabulary is undefined. Risk: agents working in this domain have no terms to retrieve. Flag as **MISSING ONTOLOGY FOR DOMAIN**.
- **Ontology without architecture**: vocabulary is defined but no structural boundary exists. Risk: terms float without ownership. Flag as **MISSING ARCHITECTURE FOR DOMAIN**.

These are structural integrity issues, not style issues.

---

## Step 5 — Drift Detection

Look for the following drift signals:

### Stale terms

A term is stale if:
- `status: active` but no code, port, or component references it
- The `used_by` field is empty or points to a component that no longer exists

```bash
Grep: "billing.customer" in src/
Grep: "billing.customer" in knowledge/architecture/
```

If the term appears in no active reference: flag as **STALE TERM — VERIFY RELEVANCE**.

### Shadow terms

A shadow term is an informal definition that has spread through code, docs, or Slack without being recorded in the ontology. Look for:

```bash
Grep: "Customer|Invoice|Order|Account" (capitalized nouns) in docs/ src/ knowledge/
```

Compare against the term index. If a concept is used consistently in multiple files but is not in the ontology, flag as **UNDOCUMENTED CONCEPT — CANDIDATE FOR ADDITION**.

### Deprecated terms not marked

Terms that appear in code but also appear in the glossary without a `status: deprecated` and `superseded_by` field:

```bash
Grep: "superseded_by|deprecated" in knowledge/ontology/
```

If a term is known to be replaced but is still marked `active`, flag as **DEPRECATED WITHOUT MARKING**.

### Diverged mappings

A mapping file says `closeMatch` but the definitions have since diverged significantly, or one of the two terms has changed without the mapping being updated. Spot-check: read the two term definitions referenced in each mapping and compare them against the stated relation type. Flag as **STALE MAPPING — VERIFY RELATION**.

---

## Step 6 — Maturity Assessment

Given the findings from Steps 1–5, assess whether the current level is still appropriate.

**Recommend upgrade when:**

| Current level | Upgrade trigger |
|---|---|
| Level 0 → 1 | More than one domain with more than 5 terms each, or more than one team |
| Level 1 → 2 | Same label in two or more domains, or teams are actively arguing about a shared word |
| Level 2 → 3 | Any domain with more than 20 terms, or terms need individual change history |

**Recommend not upgrading when:**

- The project is early-stage and ontology coverage is low — adding structure before terms exist adds overhead with no value.
- The upgrade trigger condition is not yet met.

Do not recommend a level jump beyond one step at a time. Jumping from Level 0 to Level 3 because the project is ambitious produces a structure nobody populates.

---

## Output

Produce findings grouped by severity:

### Critical (block merging / break agent retrieval)

- Missing domain qualifiers
- Undocumented collisions across domains
- Domains existing in architecture but not in ontology (or vice versa)

### Major (degrade vocabulary quality)

- Missing "Not this" exclusions
- Incomplete schema (missing required fields)
- Duplicate definitions that should be merged

### Minor (maintenance hygiene)

- Stale terms with no active references
- Deprecated terms not marked
- Shadow terms that should be added
- Stale mapping relation types

### Recommendations

- Maturity level upgrade/downgrade recommendation with trigger condition
- Specific terms to add based on undocumented concept scan
- Specific mappings to create based on collision scan

### Summary table

```
| Finding type | Count | Severity |
|---|---|---|
```

For each finding, include:
- File and line (or section) where the issue exists
- The specific problem
- The recommended fix — not just the problem

Do not summarize what you found without telling the person what to do about it.
